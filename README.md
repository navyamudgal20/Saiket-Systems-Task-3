# Saiket-Systems-Task-3
Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn for a telecommunications company using a Telco customer dataset. The goal is to identify key factors influencing churn, segment customers effectively, and generate actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective:
Understand the dataset by summarizing its main characteristics and identifying patterns, missing values, and relationships between variables.

Key Activities:

Data cleaning: Handled missing values in TotalCharges and MonthlyCharges columns by imputing median values.

Descriptive statistics: Calculated summary statistics for numerical and categorical features.

Visualization: Created graphs to analyze churn distribution by factors like tenure, gender, senior citizen status, payment method, and contract type.

Insights: Noted key trends such as higher churn rates among short-tenure customers and those with month-to-month contracts.
